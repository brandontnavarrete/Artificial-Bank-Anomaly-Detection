# Customer Transaction Data Generation and Visualization

This project aims to generate artificial customer bank transaction data and implement data visualization techniques to gain insights and detect anomalies. The project utilizes the Python Faker library for generating realistic fake data and the Schedule library for automating the data generation process.

## Features

- Generate artificial customer bank transaction data using Python Faker.
- Implement scheduled data generation to simulate daily transactions.
- Perform data preprocessing and exploration.
- Create visualizations using Matplotlib and Plotly libraries.
- Develop an automated function to generate visuals for each customer.
- Detect anomalies in the transaction data.
- Set up warnings or notifications for detected anomalies.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/customer-transaction-data.git
cd customer-transaction-data
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Customize the data generation parameters in the `data_generator.py` file. Adjust the types of transactions, customer information, and any additional attributes as per your requirements.

2. Run the data generation script:

```bash
python data_generator.py
```

3. Preprocess the generated data and explore the dataset in the `data_wrangling.py` script. You can modify the preprocessing steps according to your data requirements.

4. Implement data visualization by utilizing the visualization functions provided in `data_visualization.py`. You can customize the plot types, styles, and labels based on your visualization needs.

5. To automate the process of generating visuals for each customer, use the `automated_visualization.py` script. Modify the logic to handle daily data and generate visuals for individual customers.

6. For anomaly detection, explore existing anomaly detection algorithms or develop custom approaches based on the characteristics of your data. Integrate the detection process into the project and set up warnings or notifications as desired.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate machine learning techniques for advanced anomaly detection.
- Explore alternative data sources to create a more diverse dataset.
- Implement real-time data processing and visualization.
- Develop a web-based dashboard for interactive exploration and monitoring.
